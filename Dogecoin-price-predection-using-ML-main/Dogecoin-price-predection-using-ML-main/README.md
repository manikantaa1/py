# Dogecoin-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

Dogecoin Price Prediction with Machine Learning" involves analyzing and predicting Dogecoin prices using statistical and machine learning techniques. 

Explore and predict Dogecoin prices using ARIMA and SARIMAX models in this detailed Jupyter notebook. Dive into data exploration, understand time series forecasting, and develop machine learning models to predict cryptocurrency trends.

# It includes the following key components:
- Data Exploration: The notebook begins with loading and examining the Dogecoin price data, specifically focusing on the 'Close' price, which is the target variable for predictions. There's an exploration of correlations among different factors in the dataset.
- Model Introduction: It introduces the ARIMA model, which stands for autoregressive integrated moving average, a popular model for time series forecasting. The notebook explains the components of ARIMA and SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables), setting the stage for their application.
- Model Development: The notebook likely progresses to developing and tuning these models to predict future prices of Dogecoin, although detailed steps on this part aren't specified in the extracted content.
